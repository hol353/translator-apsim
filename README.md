#translator-apsim#

This translator for [APSIM](http://www.apsim.info) reads from AgMIP standard json file, converts it to a set of POJOs, and serializes to [APSIM](http://www.apsim.info) files using [Apache Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org). 

It has been developed  during the [2nd AgMIP Development Sprint](http://research.agmip.org/display/itwiki/July+9-13%2C+2012+Rapid+Development+Workshop), in Gainesville, FL, by Dean Holzworth and [Ioannis N. Athanasiadis](http://www.athanasiadis.info).

The translator has been updated to read APSIM XML files and convert them into the AgMIP common format using [VTD-XML](http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net). Currently reads only weather and soil information. 

It has been updated during the [4th AgMIP Development Sprint](http://research.agmip.org/display/itwiki/Austin+Hackathon%2C+February+4-8%2C+2013), in Austin, TX,  by Dean Holzworth and and [Ioannis N. Athanasiadis](http://www.athanasiadis.info).
