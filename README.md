#translator-apsim#

This translator for APSIM reads from AgMIP standard json file, converts it to a set of POJOs, and serializes to APSIM files using Velocity. 

It has been developed  during the [2nd AgMIP Development Sprint](http://research.agmip.org/display/itwiki/July+9-13%2C+2012+Rapid+Development+Workshop), in Gainesville, FL, by Dean Holzworth and [Ioannis N. Athanasiadis](http://www.athanasiadis.info).

The translator has been updated to read APSIM XML files and convert them into the AgMIP common format. Currently reads only weather and soil information. Updated during the [4th AgMIP Development Sprint](http://research.agmip.org/display/itwiki/Austin+Hackathon%2C+February+4-8%2C+2013), in Austin, TX,  by Dean Holzworth and and [Ioannis N. Athanasiadis](http://www.athanasiadis.info).
